          As leather ages, it undergoes a natural process of transformation,
          gaining character and patina over time. Exposure to elements like
          sunlight, moisture, and dirt can cause the leather to lose its
          suppleness and develop cracks or dullness. Without proper care, this
          beloved material can lose its charm, leaving owners dismayed by its
          diminished appearance.

      <div class="leather-tanning-is-container">
        <p class="long">
          Leather tanning is the process of treating animal hides to produce
          durable and flexible leather. The primary purpose of tanning is to
          stabilize the collagen fibers in the hide, making it resistant to
          decomposition and suitable for various uses. There are several tanning
          methods, each imparting distinct characteristics to the leather.
        </p>
        <p class="long">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="long">
          Vegetable tanning is one of the oldest and most traditional methods,
          using natural tannins derived from plant sources like tree bark,
          leaves, and fruits. This process can take several weeks, allowing the
          tannins to penetrate deeply into the hide. The result is a firmer,
          more rigid leather that ages beautifully, developing a rich patina
          over time. Wallets crafted from vegetable-tanned leather are prized
          for their durability and unique aesthetic, which becomes more
          pronounced with use.
